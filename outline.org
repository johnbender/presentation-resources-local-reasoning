* Separation Logic
** emp
** P * Q
** x |-> -
** x |-> a,b
** NOTES:
*** {P}C{Q}
*** superset of propositional logic (??)
* Syntax
* Mutual Exclusion Group
** racy vs race free - attempts to access same portion of state at the same time
** cautious vs daring - shared stated is accessed only from the same mutual exclusion
* Definitions
** Ownership Hypothesis
** Separation Property
* Binary Semaphore
** code sample
** NOTES:
*** assertion about the heap "appears/disappears" with semaphore
* Grammar Subset
** with r when B do C endwith
** resource(variables)
* Resource Invariants
** any command x:= ... changing a *variable* x which is free in RI_ri must occur within a critical region for r_i
